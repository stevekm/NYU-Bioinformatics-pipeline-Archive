## REQUIRED INPUT FILES/DIRECTORIES
#####################################

* release/ : symbolic link to ENSEMBL release directory, e.g. ln -s Genomes/hg19/ENSEMBL_69 release
* fastq-or-alignments/ : put all fastq[.gz] and/or bam files here (symbolic links are accepted as well)
* sample-sheet.tsv : tab-separated file with 4 fields (#FILE-NAME <TAB> SAMPLE-NAME <TAB> CONTROL-SAMPLE-NAME <TAB> GROUPS); this can be generated automatically using the ./code/create-sample-sheet.tcsh script, but you need to add the corresponding input samples for each ChIP sample (this can be done easily in Excel)
* comparisons.tsv : comparisons between pairs of samples for peakdiff
