# NYU GTC Bioinformatic Analysis Pipelines

This is the main repository for THE bioinformatics pipelines. 

## Setup
Start a new project with 
```
~/pipeline-master/code/code.main/pipeline-new-analysis <analysis type> /path/to/<project_name>
```
Where `<analysis type>` corresponds to a subdirectory from the `pipelines` directory. 

Subsequent setup steps are detailed in the corresponding pipelines' README files.
